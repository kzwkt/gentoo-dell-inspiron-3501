## Installation

It is preinstalled on instantOS.
You can manually install the git build at your own risk by cloning the repo and then running build.sh,
however you'll likely be missing a lot of other tools if you're not on instantOS.
It is not recommended to use instantWM with other distributions.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/instantOS/instantWM.git
cd instantWM
./build.sh
```
